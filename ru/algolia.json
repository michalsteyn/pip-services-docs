To make your life easier, we implemented a benchmarking framework to keep critical non-functional characteristics under constant control. In a similar vein with Pip.Service Toolkit, the framework has symmetrical implementations to make it easier to switch between programming languages.\n What benchmarking framework does: Sets up environment before the test and tears it down after the test Executes test transactions Measures performance in transactions per second or TPS Supports active (by calling Execute method) or passive (by reporting via Context) measurement methods Supports configuration parameters to set connection strings or other settings for benchmarks Runs benchmarks sequential or in proportional by allocating % of calls to each benchmark Measures peak or nominal measurement at specified transaction rate Measures system utilization (RAM and CPU) during benchmarking process Measures overall environment performance (CPU, Video, Disk) for objective interpretation of results Capture and errors or validation results Console and GUI runners to execute benchmarks  Node .","tags":null,"title":"Benchmarking Framework","type":"docs","url":"/hugo-docs/extras/benchmarks/","weight":1,"wordcount":742},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"TODO: add description\n","dir":"node/expressions/calculator/functions/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1625434391,"lvl0":"Functions","lvl1":"TODO: add description\n","lvl2":"node","lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":"","objectID":"cde62a9113193efa3df040e303107a0b","permalink":"/node/expressions/calculator/functions/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/node/expressions/calculator/functions/","section":"node","summary":" Interfaces IFunction Implements a functions list.\nIFunctionCollection Implements a functions list.\nClasses DefaultFunctionCollection Implements a list filled with standard functions.\nDelegatedFunction Defines a delegate to implement a function.\nFunctionCollection Implements a functions list.\n ","tags":null,"title":"Functions","type":"docs","url":"/hugo-docs/node/expressions/calculator/functions/","weight":1,"wordcount":33},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"TODO: add description\n","dir":"node/expressions/tokenizers/generic/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1625163129,"lvl0":"Generic","lvl1":"TODO: add description\n","lvl2":"node","lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":"","objectID":"2540bdb18f9f275f6c2fb9e218d896cc","permalink":"/node/expressions/tokenizers/generic/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/node/expressions/tokenizers/generic/","section":"node","summary":" Classes CCommentState TODO: add description\nCppCommentState TODO: add description\nGenericCommentState TODO: add description\nGenericNumberState TODO: add description\nGenericQuoteState TODO: add description\nGenericSymbolState TODO: add description\nGenericTokenizer TODO: add description\nGenericWhitespaceState TODO: add description\nGenericWordState TODO: add description\nSymbolNode TODO: add description\nSymbolRootNode TODO: add description\n ","tags":null,"title":"Generic","type":"docs","url":"/hugo-docs/node/expressions/tokenizers/generic/","weight":1,"wordcount":45},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"dart/getting_started/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"keywords":null,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1622815947,"lvl0":"Getting Started","lvl1":"","lvl2":"dart","lvl3":null,"lvl4":null,"lvl5":"","objectID":"0cf0d638ea0e78bf4ca4f2a2b0894326","permalink":"/dart/getting_started/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/dart/getting_started/","section":"dart","summary":"Toolkit Architecture The Pip.Services toolkit is divided into a few dozen modules.
